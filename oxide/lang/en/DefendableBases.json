  "Description": "Defendable Bases - The battles in this war take place in an indestructible fortress, where the human race must battle against relentless hordes of rotting flesh. According to the engineers who build these fortresses, there are several entrances around the perimeter, each leading to the main room through a single wall frame. These points create excellent places to erect a barricade with whatever scrap and junk you can find, bottleneck the hordes into these entrances and give them hell. The engineers have also provided auxiliary traps that can be activated via the computer on site. There are not many choices currently, but we have created automatic turrets, flame turrets, and shotgun traps to help rid us of these walking corpses. Let it be known, that for a dense meat grinder, and a hellish relentless onslaught of stinking undead, that the reward will be worth the stench, sweat, blood, and tears. Ready yourself humans, these fortresses are our last hope!",
